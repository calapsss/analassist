# AnalAssist - LangChain vs. Microsoft Semantic Kernel
Analysis Assistant 
Quick spin up of an analysis assistant for csv files using Microsoft Semantic Kernel and Langchain. We attempt to make a full application and compare the two implementations.

## Microsoft Semantic Kernel
### Speed of Development
- Learning curve is around 2 hours to spin up a basic app.
- Easy testing of prompts. 
- Approx 3 hours to finish the whole app without prior knowledge of semantic kernel

### Performance
- To be tested...

## LangChain
- Learning curve was really quick. 10 minutes to spin up a basic app.
- Difficult testing for prompts.
- Approx 1 hour to finish the whole app without prior knowledge of langchain
- Note that 30 mins of that 1 hour was used to setup the environment had multiple errors before working.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test Planner vs. Agents (SK vs. Langchain)
